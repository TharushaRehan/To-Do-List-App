# To-Do-List-App

I have designed and developed a user-friendly web application to manage users' day-to-day tasks. This application allows users to easily do the CRUD operations on the tasks (add a deadline), add to completed task list and add to important task list. By using this app users can manage their tasks easily.

Functionalities

1. User authentication
2. CRUD operations on the tasks
3. Mark the tasks as completed
4. Mark the tasks as important
5. Show the completed tasks
6. Show the important tasks
